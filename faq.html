    <h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h3 id="what-is-fractrade">What is Fractrade?</h3>
<p>Fractrade is an open-source AI trading platform. For more information please refer to the <a href="whitepaper.html">whitepaper</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-get-an-invite-code">How can i get an invite code?</h3>
<p>Right now we have a waiting list of users who want to participate and contacted us on X. We will respond to all DMs. In general we have three different target groups. </p>
<ol>
<li>Algorithmic traders who want to use our AI Agents and data to build fully automated trading strategies.</li>
<li>Agent publishers who want to build/publish their own agents to the marketplace.</li>
<li>End users who want to use the platform to trade and invest in the crypto market.</li>
</ol>
<p>We start the onboarding with the algoritmic traders, then the publishers and finally the end users. It makes sense for us to start with technically more advanced users, as they usually can provide the feedback and ideas to improve the platform we need right now. Also all end users will benefit from the contributions of the other two groups. Eventually we will open the platform to all users. </p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-frac-token-and-what-is-it-used-for">What is the FRAC token and what is it used for?</h3>
<p>FRAC is a utility token, not a speculative asset. Our goal isn’t to attract short-term traders but to us the FRAC token to provide access to the platform and to the AI tools, trading agents, and governance rights. Its a token to participate and benefit from the platform.</p>
<p>Unlike speculative tokens, where PvP dynamics dominate and only early buyers win, FRAC is different. Our devs hold only a small percentage—just enough to use the platform like any other trader. We want to win together.</p>
<p>So, how does everyone win? This is where Hyperliquid shines. It provides deep liquidity for perpetual trading, meaning we’re not  competing against other token holders but against the broader market.</p>
<p>It’s FRAC holders vs. the rest—and our mission is to build the best AI-driven trading strategies to come out on top.</p>
<p>Important Note: The FRAC token was not launched by us but represents a community takeover to experiment with various governance mechanisms (DAOs). We do not hold the majority of the FRAC token or have any control over it. If we decide to launch our own token in the future, all current FRAC holders will be rewarded.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-frac-tokens-are-there">How much FRAC tokens are there?</h2>
<p>There is a total supply of around 4 million FRAC tokens. The rest of the tokens were burned. Thats why Dexscreener and some external sites might show a much higher number of tokens in circulation and a 5x higher market cap. </p>
<p>Its important to notice that every Hyperliquid Spot token is by default deflationary. This means that the token supply is decreasing over time trough a burn mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-get-frac-tokens">How can I get FRAC tokens?</h2>
<p>The FRAC token was launched on the Hyperliquid protocol. You can buy it on Hyperliquid SPOT market. You have to disable the strict Filter, to be able to buy it.</p>
<h2 id="why-a-cto-instead-of-launching-our-own-token">Why a CTO instead of launching our own token?</h2>
<p>A CTO (Community Take Over) means that we just market bought the token like everyone else and build a product around it. Before our CTO the token was originally launched by the Fractality AI team but they abandoned it. The token is not our product and not our main focus. We are using it to experiment with various governance, access control and reward distribution mechanisms. Taking over an existing token was the much cheaper and faster option to get started.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-devs-are-working-on-fractrade">How many devs are working on Fractrade?</h2>
<p>We are a small team of 5-6 people now but still growing. If you are interested in joining the team, please refer to the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page. Most of our code is open source and we are happy to receive contributions from anyone interested in algorithmic trading and AI.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-team-doxxed">Is the team doxxed?</h2>
<p>We are not hiding but also not influencers posting daily selfies. Our focus is our product and building something great. </p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-contribute-to-fractrade">How can I contribute to Fractrade?</h2>
<p>Join our community, check out the <a href="https://github.com/fractrade-xyz">GitHub repository</a>, read the docs, try out the platform and tell us what you think.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-distinguish-from-other-projects-in-the-defai-space-like-hyperfly-h">How do you distinguish from other projects in the DefAI space like Hyperfly (H)?</h2>
<p>Hyperfly uses AI to understand you and inform the blockchain what you want.</p>
<p>Fractrade uses AI to understand the blockchain (and off-chain data) to inform you.</p>
<p>Both tools complement each other. With FRAC, you know what to do. With FLY, you can execute it in natural language. Our technology stack can do the same, but thats just not our focus.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-distinguish-from-other-projects-in-the-ai-space">How do you distinguish from other projects in the AI space?</h2>
<p>We are not another ChatGPT interface, API wrapper or pure whitepaper project. There is enough content and information out there, we dont believe adding more is the best way to contribute. Our focus is on using AI to benefit from the masses in available informations and data to help you make better decisions.</p>
<p>Also we are using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which means our custom LLMs have access to real time data and information.</p>
<p>Besides that we are focusing on having a real product that you can use and benefit from and a real income stream. Our business model is based on our own trading agents, subscriptions, marketplace fees and more.</p>
<h2 id="when-do-you-expect-to-launch-feature-xyz">When do you expect to launch feature XYZ?</h2>
<p>When its ready. Simple as that. We are building novel things which might take longer and usually we are overly optimistic about the timeline. But as a founder i guess we have to be, otherwise we never would start. So we try to avoid communication about timelines and instead focus on building.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-teams-background">Whats the teams background?</h2>
<p>We are a team of experienced traders and developers. We have a strong background in algorithmic trading, AI and software development. We have build other successful crypto related projects before and participated in various Hackatons. Most of our tools where private so far and on EVM based chains. </p>
<h2 id="why-do-you-build-in-public">Why do you build in public?</h2>
<p>We post usually nearly daily updates about the project on X. We try to be transparent and share our learnings and thoughts. Things might take longer, things might break, things might get really interesting. We dont know. But we will find out together and building in public is a great way to do that. It also keeps us motivated and accountable and hopefully builds trust and helps you to understand our journey.</p>
<h2 id="any-other-questions">Any other questions?</h2>
<p>If you have any other questions, please refer to the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
