# Hyperliquid SDK

The Hyperliquid SDK is a Python library that allows you to interact with the Hyperliquid protocol. There is the official  [Python Hyperliquid SDK](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk) which we found quite complex and hard to use. So we decided to build our own SDK, which is more user friendly and easier to use. 

## Installation and Usage
