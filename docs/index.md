# fractrade.xyz Documentation

Welcome to the fractrade.xyz documentation! Learn how to use and contribute to the Fractrade platform and be proud of yourself to even read the docs ;) This documentation is more targeted towards technical users who want to understand the platform and do some serious stuff with it. If you have any questions, just ask in our Twitter community here: [@fractrade](https://x.com/i/communities/1886099096630382819)

## Quickstart

For "normal"users, just [signup here](https://app.fractrade.xyz/) and explore the platform. Right now an invite code is required, but that will change soon. We have a waiting list right now, but will respond to all Twitter DMs.
