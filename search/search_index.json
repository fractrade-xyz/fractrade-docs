The main components are: fractrade.xyz Main website with some infos fractrade.xyz App The webapp is the main interface for interacting with your Agents, creating new agents, researching strategies, etc. fractrade docs This documentation Fractrade ExecutionClient Open source Python client for executing trades on Hyperliquid, receives signals from your Agents. Fractrade Telegram Bot Telegram bot for getting notifications from your Agents. Fractrade Client API API for interacting with your Agents. Fractrade Publisher API API for publishing trading signals and data. Fractrade AI Agent Framework Open Source framework for creating and training AI agents which can publish signals and data to the Publisher API. Fractrade Worker Distributed task queue for executing all platform tasks like sending signals, executing trades, doing custom calculations, scanning the Hyperliquid ecosystem, monitoring on-chain data and offchain data, etc. How it works for users Users can signup on the fractrade.xyz App. They can research strategies and configure custom AI agents which execute their preferred strategies. Some strategies are generic, which means the send the same signals/data for all users. Other strategies are custom, which means the send different signals/data for each user. Generic strategies Examples include: A new token launched on Hyperliquid A new PERP is available on Hyperliquid The Market sentiment on Twitter changed Custom strategies Examples include: Your portfolio made 300% profit in token X, you might want to rebalance part of the profits into token Y There is a big TWAP order executing for one of the tokens in your portfolio The smart wallet you are following just bought a new token XYZ Your current open long position on BTC-PERP is at risk. There is an upcoming FOMC meeting increasing the volatility of the market and you are near a resistance level When your agent and strategy are setup, you can start the agent and see the signals in the UI, on the Websockets and can subscribe to them with the Telegram Bot. If you trade manually on Hyperliquid, using the fractrade.xyz App UI makes sense. For users who want to trade in Telegram with out Telegram Bot integration, setting up the agent subscription in Telegram is useful. And for fully automated algorithmic trading, you want to use the websocket connection to your agent, which gives you all signals in real time and allows you to act on the data or execute trades. Agents each have an input and an output. We are basically just passing a JSON data structure from one agent to the next. The output of the previous agent is the input for the next agent and so on. That way we can easily combine multiple agents to create more complex strategies. Your execution client then would just connect to the websocket of the last ageent in the chain and receive the final data / signals. How it works for Publishers Developers can use our publisher framework to create custom strategies and data endpoints. They can be published on the marketplace and also require a subscription payment in USDC. Especially running complex AI models might require some resources and a subscription is the only way to make it sustainable. To get our marketplace started, fractrade.xyz will offer a set of strategies, data endpoints and agents ready to use, but eventually our goal is to have a marketplace with thousands of strategies, data endpoints and agents.

Fractrade is an open-source AI trading platform. For more information please refer to the whitepaper . How can i get an invite code? Right now we have a waiting list of users who want to participate and contacted us on X. We will respond to all DMs. In general we have three different target groups. Algorithmic traders who want to use our AI Agents and data to build fully automated trading strategies. Agent publishers who want to build/publish their own agents to the marketplace. End users who want to use the platform to trade and invest in the crypto market. We start the onboarding with the algoritmic traders, then the publishers and finally the end users. It makes sense for us to start with technically more advanced users, as they usually can provide the feedback and ideas to improve the platform we need right now. Also all end users will benefit from the contributions of the other two groups. Eventually we will open the platform to all users. What is the FRAC token and what is it used for? FRAC is a utility token, not a speculative asset. Our goal isn\u2019t to attract short-term traders but to us the FRAC token to provide access to the platform and to the AI tools, trading agents, and governance rights. Its a token to participate and benefit from the platform. Unlike speculative tokens, where PvP dynamics dominate and only early buyers win, FRAC is different. Our devs hold only a small percentage\u2014just enough to use the platform like any other trader. We want to win together. So, how does everyone win? This is where Hyperliquid shines. It provides deep liquidity for perpetual trading, meaning we\u2019re not competing against other token holders but against the broader market. It\u2019s FRAC holders vs. the rest\u2014and our mission is to build the best AI-driven trading strategies to come out on top. Important Note: The FRAC token was not launched by us but represents a community takeover to experiment with various governance mechanisms (DAOs). We do not hold the majority of the FRAC token or have any control over it. If we decide to launch our own token in the future, all current FRAC holders will be rewarded. How much FRAC tokens are there? There is a total supply of around 4 million FRAC tokens. The rest of the tokens were burned. Thats why Dexscreener and some external sites might show a much higher number of tokens in circulation and a 5x higher market cap. Its important to notice that every Hyperliquid Spot token is by default deflationary. This means that the token supply is decreasing over time trough a burn mechanism. How can I get FRAC tokens? The FRAC token was launched on the Hyperliquid protocol. You can buy it on Hyperliquid SPOT market. You have to disable the strict Filter, to be able to buy it. Why a CTO instead of launching our own token? A CTO (Community Take Over) means that we just market bought the token like everyone else and build a product around it. Before our CTO the token was originally launched by the Fractality AI team but they abandoned it. The token is not our product and not our main focus. We are using it to experiment with various governance, access control and reward distribution mechanisms. Taking over an existing token was the much cheaper and faster option to get started. How many devs are working on Fractrade? We are a small team of 5-6 people now but still growing. If you are interested in joining the team, please refer to the contact page. Most of our code is open source and we are happy to receive contributions from anyone interested in algorithmic trading and AI. Is the team doxxed? We are not hiding but also not influencers posting daily selfies. Our focus is our product and building something great. How can I contribute to Fractrade? Join our community, check out the GitHub repository , read the docs, try out the platform and tell us what you think. How do you distinguish from other projects in the DefAI space like Hyperfly (H)? Hyperfly uses AI to understand you and inform the blockchain what you want. Fractrade uses AI to understand the blockchain (and off-chain data) to inform you. Both tools complement each other. With FRAC, you know what to do. With FLY, you can execute it in natural language. Our technology stack can do the same, but thats just not our focus. How do you distinguish from other projects in the AI space? We are not another ChatGPT interface, API wrapper or pure whitepaper project. There is enough content and information out there, we dont believe adding more is the best way to contribute. Our focus is on using AI to benefit from the masses in available informations and data to help you make better decisions. Also we are using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which means our custom LLMs have access to real time data and information. Besides that we are focusing on having a real product that you can use and benefit from and a real income stream. Our business model is based on our own trading agents, subscriptions, marketplace fees and more. When do you expect to launch feature XYZ? When its ready. Simple as that. We are building novel things which might take longer and usually we are overly optimistic about the timeline. But as a founder i guess we have to be, otherwise we never would start. So we try to avoid communication about timelines and instead focus on building. Whats the teams background? We are a team of experienced traders and developers. We have a strong background in algorithmic trading, AI and software development. We have build other successful crypto related projects before and participated in various Hackatons. Most of our tools where private so far and on EVM based chains. Why do you build in public? We post usually nearly daily updates about the project on X. We try to be transparent and share our learnings and thoughts. Things might take longer, things might break, things might get really interesting. We dont know. But we will find out together and building in public is a great way to do that. It also keeps us motivated and accountable and hopefully builds trust and helps you to understand our journey.

Manual trading requires an immense time commitment, with traders often glued to their screens for hours, monitoring volatile price movements and analyzing complex data. Emotions, a natural part of human decision-making, frequently interfere with rational trading strategies, leading to impulsive decisions, losses, and stress. This emotional toll is especially pronounced in the cryptocurrency market, where unpredictable swings can test even the most disciplined traders. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7, offering no breaks or downtime. While humans need rest and sleep, the market continues, making it impossible for traders to monitor and respond to opportunities or risks at all times. Adding to these challenges is the overwhelming volume of information traders must consider\u2014from technical analysis and news updates to social media trends and market sentiment. The sheer amount of data makes it difficult to identify actionable insights and develop effective strategies. These factors combined create a trading environment that is not only stressful but also inefficient, leaving room for innovative solutions to address these inherent challenges. The Idea: Leveraging AI for Smarter, Emotion-Free Trading The solution to the challenges of manual trading lies in harnessing the power of advanced artificial intelligence. FRACTRADE proposes leveraging cutting-edge technologies, including large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI agents, to revolutionize the way we trade. AI agents are uniquely equipped to handle the complexities of trading. They excel at processing massive amounts of data, identifying patterns, and extracting actionable insights from diverse sources\u2014all in real time. Unlike human traders, AI agents operate 24/7 without the need for breaks, ensuring constant market monitoring and responsiveness. They are immune to the emotional pitfalls that plague human decision-making, such as fear, greed, or panic. As AI agents continue to evolve, their capabilities grow, enabling them to perform increasingly sophisticated tasks. The idea behind FRACTRADE is to create a suite of specialized AI agents that work collaboratively to support both manual and fully automated trading strategies. These agents can assist traders by managing risk, developing strategies, identifying market opportunities, and analyzing vast amounts of data efficiently and effectively. By combining human expertise with the relentless precision of AI, FRACTRADE aims to empower traders with tools that enhance decision-making, reduce stress, and unlock new levels of trading efficiency and profitability. Market Analysis The cryptocurrency trading landscape has experienced significant growth, with Hyperliquid emerging as a leading example of innovation in the space. In 2024, Hyperliquid became one of the fastest-growing layer-1 blockchains, driven by its ability to support high-frequency trading and advanced financial applications. The platform currently accounts for billions of dollars in Total Value Locked (TVL) and generates millions in revenue annually, reflecting the increasing activity in decentralized trading environments. The demand for trading solutions is substantial, fueled by the global appeal of cryptocurrencies and their 24/7 market dynamics. Key metrics demonstrate this growth, including a steady rise in spot trading volumes and transaction fees. According to data from Hypurrscan.io/stats, trading activity on platforms like Hyperliquid continues to expand, supported by a growing user base and increasing institutional interest. This growth trajectory underscores the importance of developing tools capable of handling the complexities of modern trading. With billions in liquidity and continuous market participation, the need for systems that optimize trading strategies, process vast datasets, and operate without downtime is more evident than ever. FRACTRADE aims to address these requirements, building on the momentum within the market and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create solutions tailored for the next phase of cryptocurrency trading. LLM and AI: Foundations and Applications in Trading Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are underpinned by deep learning, a sophisticated subset of machine learning that relies on artificial neural networks to simulate how humans process information. Deep learning is designed to uncover patterns and relationships in data by stacking multiple layers of interconnected \"neurons,\" each layer transforming its input to produce more abstract and meaningful representations. How Deep Learning Works Deep learning models are typically structured as multi-layer neural networks. Each neuron in a layer processes a small piece of information, passing it to the next layer for further refinement. These networks consist of three main types of layers: Input Layer: Receives raw data, such as price movements, news text, or other inputs relevant to trading. Hidden Layers: Perform computations, often numbering in the hundreds or thousands, to identify patterns and correlations within the data. These layers utilize non-linear activation functions to capture complex relationships. Output Layer: Provides the final result, such as a prediction or classification (e.g., market sentiment, trading signals). The model is trained using backpropagation, where errors in predictions are calculated and used to adjust the model's internal weights. With enough training data, these systems can achieve remarkable accuracy in pattern recognition, language understanding, and decision-making. How LLMs Work LLMs like GPT are built on transformer architectures, which have revolutionized natural language processing. Key concepts include: Attention Mechanisms: These allow the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data. For instance, when analyzing a news article, the model identifies critical phrases or sentences that carry the most weight in determining market sentiment. Tokenization: Text input is broken into smaller units called tokens (e.g., words or subwords), enabling the model to process language systematically. Pretraining and Fine-Tuning: LLMs are pretrained on massive datasets covering diverse topics, learning general language patterns. They can then be fine-tuned on domain-specific data, such as financial news, to specialize in tasks relevant to trading. LLMs excel at language-based tasks, such as summarizing market reports, extracting sentiment from social media, and providing natural language explanations for trading strategies. Limitations of LLMs in Trading While powerful, LLMs have inherent limitations in trading applications: Lack of Real-Time Data Processing: LLMs are not inherently designed to work with streaming data, such as live market feeds. Their capabilities are best applied to static or near-real-time datasets. Complex Numerical Reasoning: Although improving, LLMs sometimes struggle with precise calculations or making decisions based purely on numerical data. Memory Constraints: LLMs often operate within a limited context window, making it challenging to analyze long-term dependencies without custom configurations. Applications of Deep Learning and LLMs in Trading Despite these limitations, LLMs and AI play a crucial role in augmenting trading operations. Key applications include: Market Sentiment Analysis: Using transformer-based LLMs, traders can monitor social media, forums, and news feeds to identify shifts in sentiment that might signal market movements. Risk Management: Deep learning models can evaluate and optimize portfolio risk dynamically, factoring in market volatility and trader-specific parameters. Data Integration: AI systems can aggregate and analyze diverse datasets, including technical indicators, macroeconomic data, and alternative data sources, to identify correlations and opportunities. Strategy Optimization: LLMs can analyze historical trading performance and assist in backtesting and refining strategies, ensuring better alignment with current market conditions. Automation of Insights: AI can generate concise, actionable insights from extensive datasets, saving traders time while improving decision-making accuracy. By leveraging the capabilities of deep learning and LLMs in conjunction with real-time data processing tools, FRACTRADE creates a robust framework for modern trading. This integration ensures a balance between static, language-oriented tasks and dynamic, data-driven operations, maximizing both efficiency and effectiveness. AI Agents: Specialized Systems for Smarter Trading An AI agent is a software entity designed to autonomously perform specific tasks within a defined environment. These agents operate by perceiving their surroundings, analyzing available data, and taking actions to achieve predefined goals. Unlike general AI systems, agents are typically specialized, focusing on distinct tasks and optimizing performance in their specific domain. AI agents can be enhanced with fine-tuned models, enabling them to excel in tasks like data analysis, decision-making, or interaction with external systems. They are capable of learning from experience, adapting to changing environments, and working collaboratively to tackle complex challenges. Why Use an Agent-Based System in Trading? The complexities of trading make it a natural fit for an agent-based system. Markets operate continuously, producing vast amounts of data and requiring constant vigilance and precision. AI agents bring several advantages to the trading process: Specialization: Agents can be fine-tuned for specific trading functions, such as risk management, market analysis, sentiment analysis, strategy development, and execution. 24/7 Operation: Unlike humans, agents can operate around the clock, ensuring continuous market monitoring and quick responses to opportunities or risks. Efficiency and Scalability: By delegating specific tasks to different agents, the system avoids bottlenecks and operates more efficiently. Emotion-Free Trading: Agents make decisions based on data and predefined rules, eliminating the emotional biases that often lead to poor trading outcomes. Collaboration Among AI Agents A key strength of an agent-based system lies in the ability of agents to operate collaboratively, forming a multi-agent system. In such a system, agents communicate and share insights to optimize overall performance. For example: Data Flow and Insights: A sentiment analysis agent might detect a surge in positive sentiment around a cryptocurrency and pass this information to a market analysis agent. Task Division: Agents divide responsibilities, such as one focusing on risk assessment while another identifies potential trade entries. Feedback Loops: Agents can exchange feedback to improve decision-making. Fine-Tuning and LLM Integration Each agent can be fine-tuned using specialized large language models or other AI techniques to perform optimally in its designated role. For example: A sentiment analysis agent might use a transformer-based LLM fine-tuned on financial news and social media data. A strategy optimization agent might leverage a model trained on historical trading data to refine strategies dynamically. This agent-based approach enables FRACTRADE to address the diverse challenges of trading with precision, efficiency, and adaptability, creating a robust ecosystem tailored to the demands of modern financial markets. RAG and CAG: Real-Time Data with Speed and Efficiency The Limitation of Pretrained LLMs Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for understanding and generating language, but they come with a critical limitation: they rely on static, preexisting data. These models are trained on datasets that represent a snapshot of the past and are not inherently connected to live, real-time data streams. This limitation is particularly problematic for trading, where success often depends on analyzing the most current information, such as live market prices, breaking news, social media sentiment, or on-chain cryptocurrency transactions. RAG: Bridging LLMs with Real-Time Data Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining the generative power of LLMs with real-time data retrieval mechanisms. RAG operates by introducing an intermediary step: retrieving relevant, up-to-date information from external sources and incorporating it into the model's processing pipeline. Here's how RAG works in detail: Data Vectorization: Real-time data, such as tweets, news articles, or on-chain transactions, is first converted into vectorized representations using embeddings. Embeddings transform textual or numerical information into a dense, numerical format that captures its meaning or relevance. Specialized Vector Databases: These embeddings are stored in vector databases, which are optimized for similarity searches. When a query is made, the database quickly identifies the most relevant data points by comparing their embeddings to the query vector. Dynamic Data Integration: During inference, the LLM generates a query based on the task at hand (e.g., analyzing the sentiment of recent tweets about Bitcoin). The vector database retrieves the most relevant real-time data, which is then injected into the model's prompt as contextual information. Enhanced Outputs: The LLM uses the retrieved data to generate outputs that reflect both its pretrained knowledge and the most recent, real-time insights. This allows the system to respond dynamically to evolving conditions. CAG: Cache-Augmented Generation for Faster Responses While RAG excels at integrating real-time data, frequent queries to external data sources can introduce latency. Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) addresses this by caching frequently accessed or recently retrieved data, significantly improving response times. Here's how CAG works: Caching Frequently Used Data: When an AI agent retrieves data from external sources, it stores the results in a local cache for future use. Fast Retrieval from Cache: For subsequent queries that match or closely resemble cached data, the system retrieves the information directly from the cache instead of querying external sources. Cache Updates: The cache is periodically refreshed to ensure that data remains relevant and accurate, balancing speed with the need for up-to-date information. Benefits of Combining RAG and CAG in Trading The integration of RAG and CAG provides a robust framework for balancing real-time data accuracy and system efficiency: Real-Time Responsiveness: RAG ensures that agents have access to the latest data, critical for high-frequency or fast-moving markets. Faster Decision-Making: CAG accelerates responses by leveraging cached data for commonly accessed queries, reducing latency and improving the system's ability to react to immediate trading opportunities. Optimized Resource Use: By caching data, the system minimizes redundant data retrieval operations, reducing computational overhead and improving scalability. Use Cases in Trading Social Media Sentiment Analysis: A Sentiment Analysis Agent retrieves recent tweets about Bitcoin. If a new query arrives shortly after, CAG checks the cache for previously retrieved tweets, providing faster results without redundant API calls. On-Chain Transaction Monitoring: An agent monitoring Ethereum blockchain activity caches high-priority transaction data, ensuring rapid responses to queries about recent large transactions or wallet movements. Market Data: Price and volume data frequently accessed during trading sessions can be cached for instant retrieval while still periodically refreshing from live feeds.
